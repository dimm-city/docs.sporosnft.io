Our project was born out of lifelong friendships. So, helping to create those type of connections is one of our top priorities. We are passionate about fostering friendships through creativity and game play. The project currently focuses on two primary ways to enable game play. In the near team, we will be encouraging our community to become active in Vrumble. While we are busy dominating those leader boards, we are also hard at work finishing up our custom tools to facilitate using your Sporo to play RPG adventures. 

 

To help foster creativity we are building a platform to allow creators to collaborate and publish content relating to their Sporos. Initially this will be through the ability to customize your Sporos by giving them a name, personality and even backstory. From there we will begin to enable additional features to allow further customization of your characters and even contribute to the Sporo's lore!
