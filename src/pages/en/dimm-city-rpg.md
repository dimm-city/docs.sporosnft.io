The Dimm City RPG is a campaign setting and rules expansion for the Quest RPG, or what could be called a Quest RPG Homebrew. We chose Quest as the foundation of our game for several reasons but I would like to highlight two. 

 

First, we felt it was easily approachable for first time TTRPG players making it fun and easy to get started. Secondly, we liked the focus Quest puts on the story and creativity as the center of the focus. This allowed us to easily bring the Dimm City setting into the game while allowing creative freedom with rules as a secondary focus. 

 

However, we come from a DnD background and do love some "crunch!" This is where the rules expansion comes into play. We decided to make a few tweaks to the Quest system to allow for some more "crunch" for those of that enjoy math... okay let's be honest, we enjoy dice rolling and smashing Orc skulls!!! 

 

So we added some additional room for flair in the combat system by extended the max HP for characters, increasing max damage on weapons, and some other adjustments. One of my personal favorites is the addition of cybernetic modifications for our characters!! 

 

More info to come but we feel like this system will bring the fantastic world of the Sporos into a fun and easy system you can use to explore your own dreams within Dimm City!
