The Sporos NFT project's primary focus is to build a collaborative world. This is acchomplished by digital story telling in various falvors such as short stories, visual art, and audio soundscapes. The purpose of this collobartive world is to provide a foundation and a context that creators can use in their own creations. All foundational content is available via the open Creative Commons Attribution licensing model to allow for creative freedom. 

Additonally, this collaborative world is based in land of dreams to allow creative flexibility and stylistic freedom. The world centers around the story of the Sporos and how their world interacts with ours.

## Who are the Sporos?

Sporos are the citizens of another world. They live their lives much as we do, but their lives exist in what some call the Ether, or more commonly, the dream world. Those of us that are aware while we sleep, may have seen this world before. It can be a world of wondrous adventure or haunting nightmares. Our project follows their story, explores the interplay between our worlds, and connects with the Sporos to bring their world to life!

The founders have created a tool to establish connections to this dream world. Using these connections they were able to glean information about the world of the Sporos. In doing so, they discovered a massive metropolis known as Dimm City. Since then they have been able to collect data about the city, its citizens, and much more.
