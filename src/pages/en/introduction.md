## Who are the Sporos?

 Sporos are the citizens of another world. They live their lives much as we do, but their lives exist in what some call the Ether, or more commonly, the dream world. Those of us that are aware while we sleep, may have seen this world before. It can be a world of wondrous adventure or haunting nightmares. Our project follows their story, explores the interplay between our worlds, and connects with the Sporos to bring their world to life!

The founders have created a tool to establish connections to this dream world. Using these connections they were able to glean information about the world of the Sporos. In doing so they discovered a massive metropolis known as Dimm City. Since then they have been able to collect data about the city, its citizens, and much more.
