Now they have made this information available to everyone! Anyone can access the information they are extracting from the dream world using the Dimm City Console.

Sporos holders (aka operators) can use the console to connect to their Sporos, bridge the two worlds, and begin telling their Sporo's stories! This is done by customizing their Sporos with personality, backstory, and other details. This creates a bond between the operator and the Sporo and this bond is then strengthened by adventuring through the dream world together.

So what does that look like in our world? Today this adventure happens by customizing your character online and then using them within a tabletop RPG game. We are finalizing tools within the Dimm City Console that will allow you to download your Sporo's information directly to a character sheet that can be used to play the Quest RPG game system.

Once these tools are online, we will host live game sessions with founders and community members using the character sheets they have created for their Sporos. Sporos that participate will be rewarded with POAPs and can earn chances to win giveaways or other prizes. But they will also get something even cooler than all of that!

All game sessions hosted by the project team will be published in story form on the Dimm City site. This means all of the Sporos that participate in the game sessions will become part of the history of Dimm City itself!

So mint your Sporo, build your characters, and come be part of history in the making!
